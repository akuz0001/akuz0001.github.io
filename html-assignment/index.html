    <p> My name is Elsie and i love cooking food and taking walks. My Birthday is on the 15<sup>th</sup> of November. My favorite colors are <em>brown, purple and sage green</em>.I am obsessed with Michael Jackson and i wish i could sing and dance as good as him.</p>
    <br> 
    <p> I work at Color Me Mine which is a pottery painting place in Bayshore Mall. I am currently enrolled in a course called <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. One of my all time favourite quote would be<blockquote>The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.-<cite>Nelson Mandela</cite> </q></p>
